# Personal-blog-with-Django
My Django personal blog is a website that I created using the Django web framework for my sister to share her thoughts and experiences online. I wanted to create a visually appealing and user-friendly platform for her to express herself and engage with her readers.

I chose to use Django for my personal blog because it offers a range of benefits. First, it's a powerful and flexible framework that makes it easy to create dynamic web applications quickly. Additionally, Django is highly customizable, which means I was able to tailor the blog to my sister's specific needs and preferences.

Another important benefit of using Django for personal blogs is the built-in security features. With Django's robust security measures, including protection against common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting, I can be sure that my sister's blog is better protected from hacking attempts and other malicious attacks.

## 2. Bubble sort

Bubble Sort is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.The process is repeated until the list is sorted in the desired order.
Bubble sort has a worst-case and average-case time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of items being sorted. This makes it inefficient for large data sets and it is generally not used in practice for that reason. However, it is still a good algorithm for small data sets and for educational purposes, as it is easy to understand and implement.

## 3. Merge sort
Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort an array. It divides the unsorted list into n sub-lists, each containing one element, and then repeatedly merges sub-lists to produce new, sorted sub-lists until there is only one sub-list remaining.
The key advantage of Merge Sort is its guaranteed O(n log n) time complexity, making it an efficient sorting algorithm for large data sets. It is also a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that the relative order of equal elements is preserved in the sorted output.
Merge Sort is often implemented using a recursive approach, but can also be implemented iteratively. Its primary disadvantage is its high memory requirement, as it requires additional memory proportional to the size of the input data to perform the merging of sub-lists. Despite this, Merge Sort is widely used due to its guaranteed performance and ease of implementation.
